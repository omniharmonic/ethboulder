2. Detailed UX/UI Flow & Interaction Design
2.1 Homepage: Topographical Sound Wave Ecosystem
Initial State (2D Entry)

Users arrive to a minimal loading animation featuring a single sound wave pulse that expands outward in concentric circles
The 2D topographical map emerges gradually, styled as elegant contour lines in dark teal (#0D4F5C) against deep space black (#0B0B0F)
Subtle ambient sound waves ripple across the surface, creating a meditative entry point
